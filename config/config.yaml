### STAR
## default parameters change these to your specific needs

##change STAR's --sjdbOverhang option; ideal value here is read_length-1
##e.g.: 2x100b paired-end reads, the ideal value is 100-1=99; varying length? then, do this with the max length
limitGenomeGenerateRAM: 60000000000
read_length_star_index: 99


## parameters when running usual pipeline ##
## option --genomeLoad NoShared memory will load into memory the whole index on each mapping run and delete it after the mapping ##
## with big genomes this is VERY memory intensive! e.g. the index for barley is ~ 40 Gb - so keep this in mind when setting the amount of paralelisation ##
## for example with 24 cores specified and a 6 threads per STAR align job: 24/6 = 4; 4 x 40 Gb ~ around 160  Gb of memory required! ##
## you can change the --genomeLoad parameter to other options e.g. keeping in memory one index for all mappings - however this can't be used in conjunction with 2-PASS mapping ##
## also removal of the index from memory would require an additional rule or manual removal via ipcs/ipcrm after everything is finished -- might change this in the future.. ##

## automatic filtering for longest isoform of fasta files
## -> very stable for standard fasta files from e.g. Ensembl, NCBI, etc.
## when not set to "YES", we assume you performed appropiate (or no) filtering yourself
### if you perform the filtering yourself and want to perform gene level Diff. Exp. Analysis take care to have the fasta headers for a protein to be the simple gene identifier (no .1; .p3; etc.)
### choosing automatic isoform filtering will create a subset peptide fasta file with only the longest isoform per gene; the header will be shortened to JUST the gene name identifier; this option MUST be used in conjunction with transcript_level_quantification: "NO"
### this is important since for the differential expression analysis we use tximport to reduce the cdna based quantification with tximport/kallisto to gene level (featureCounts if DNA fasta supplied),
### and association between orthology and expression analysis is the purpose of this software
### The choice to use gene or transcript level diff. exp. analysis is controlled by transcript_level_quantification: "YES" - set it to "NO" if you want gene level analysis
#IN ANY USE-CASE: THE NAMES BETWEEN PEP. FASTA AND EITHER GENES OR TRANSCRIPTS IN THE SPECIES SPECIFIC GTF HAS TO MATCH!!
#### some examples: 
##### case 1. you have standard fasta and annotation files from ensembl/NCBI; want to have one rep. protein seq. per GENE and trust the automatic process -> auto_isoform_filtering: "YES" & transcript_level_quantification: "NO"
##### case 2. you filtered for longest isoform yourself (peptide fasta headers = gene names in respective gtf!) and are ok with the names being reduced to gene identifier -> auto_isoform_filtering: "NO" & transcript_level_quantification: "NO"
##### case 3. you don't want to our filter & either want to use the whole or a custom subset of the transcriptome -> auto_isoform_filtering: "NO" & transcript_level_quantification: "YES"
###### case 3 continued: this is the hands-on case in which you the USER are mostly responsible; again, both featureCounts/tximport(kallisto) will produce count tables with the transcript names as found in the gtf;
###### case 3 continued: these transcript names have to match the headers in the peptide fasta files
auto_isoform_filtering: "NO"
transcript_level_quantification: "YES"

## options for expansion analyses

# define the expansion factor, e.g. 2 -> expanded species has to have 2-times the genes for the HOG to be considered "expanded"
# <- use this explanation somewhere more appropiate


## Tree visualizations often are more informative if we use more than an individual (H)OG

# define the max number of additional best blast hits to include in the follow-up analyses
# tree visualizations often are more informative if we use more than an individual (H)OG
add_blast_hits: 50

# the trees can be more informative if one looks at additional complete OGs and not just single best additional matches
# define the max number of additional OGs to include in the follow-up analyses
# this is based on the best blast hits of the expanded OG in question;
# the next based blast hit belonging to another OG will lead to include this OG in an addtional set
# if set to e.g. 3 for each expanded OG we include the next three "closest" OGs
# if there aren't any usable blast hits less than 3 will be added
# set to 0 if you aren't interested in this (only the base OG which will be analyzed)
